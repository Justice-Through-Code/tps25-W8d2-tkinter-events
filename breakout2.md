# W8D2 - Tkinter Events - Breakout 2

Breakout #2 – Interactive Label Color
Goal:
 Give fellows hands-on experience with mouse event handling in Tkinter. This reinforces how GUIs respond not only to keyboard inputs but also to mouse actions like hovering and clicking.

Instructions:
Fellows should:

    Create a Label widget with text (e.g., “Hover over me!”).

    Use .bind("<Enter>", ...) to change the text color when the mouse pointer enters the label area.

    Use .bind("<Leave>", ...) to reset the text color when the pointer leaves the label.

    (Bonus) Add .bind("<Button-1>", ...) to change the background color when the user clicks on the label.


Additional Challenges (Time permitting):

    - Toggle between two background colors on each click.

    - Display the current mouse coordinates using event.x and event.y.

    - Change font size dynamically on hover.

    - Add sound or animation (if advanced enough).
